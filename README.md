# Student_data_management
This Java project demonstrates fundamental array manipulation techniques using a collection of `Student` objects.  It covers adding, removing, and updating student records within an array structure. This is a great exercise for learning about arrays and object-oriented programming in Java.

## Features

* **Adding Students:**  New student records can be added to the array.
* **Removing Students:** Existing student records can be removed from the array.
* **Updating Students:**  Information for existing students (e.g., name) can be updated.
* **Printing Student Records:** Displays the current list of students and their details.
